# LangGraph Ping-Pong State Machine

This project demonstrates a simple LangGraph-based state machine that loops between two nodes ("ping" and "pong") until a condition is met.

### What It Does:
- Starts at the "ping" node
- Alternates between "ping" and "pong"
- Stops when `count >= 6`
- Uses conditional edges and loop control with LangGraph
